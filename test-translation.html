        <h1>Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Book</h1>
        <p>This is a comprehensive guide to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. The book covers advanced topics in artificial intelligence, robotics, and human-computer interaction.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI</h2>
        <p>Physical AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence research. It emphasizes the importance of physical embodiment in creating truly intelligent systems. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate purely in digital spaces, Physical AI systems interact with the real world through sensors and actuators.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 2: Humanoid Robotics Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>Humanoid robots are robots with human-like features and capabilities. They are designed to interact with humans and operate in human environments. These robots often have legs, arms, and a head, and may have a face with human-like features.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 3: Applications of Physical AI</h2>
        <p>The applications of Physical AI are vast and varied. From healthcare and education to manufacturing and entertainment, Physical AI systems are transforming industries and creating new possibilities for human-robot collaboration.</p>

        <p>Physical AI systems demonstrate the potential for more natural and intuitive human-robot interaction. By combining advanced AI algorithms with physical embodiment, these systems can better understand and respond to the complexities of the real world.</p>
