# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book and set up your learning environment.

## Personalize Your Learning Experience

When you first access the book, you'll be prompted to complete a brief onboarding questionnaire about your background:

- Software background (beginner, intermediate, advanced, none)
- Hardware background (beginner, intermediate, advanced, none)
- Robotics experience (beginner, intermediate, advanced, none)

Based on your responses, the content will be automatically adapted to match your experience level. You can always change your personalization level later using the personalization button.

## Using the Embedded Chatbot
