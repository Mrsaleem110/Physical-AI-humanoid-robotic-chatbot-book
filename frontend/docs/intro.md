# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This book is designed to take you from foundational concepts to advanced implementations in the field of humanoid robotics.

## What You'll Learn

This book is organized into four comprehensive modules, each containing four detailed chapters:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Learn about middleware for robot control, ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services, Python → ROS control via rclpy, and URDF for humanoid robots.

- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Explore physics simulation fundamentals, gravity, collision, and environment modeling, Unity-based HRI visualization, and sensor simulation including LiDAR, Depth Camera, and IMU.

- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - Discover Isaac Sim photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS accelerated VSLAM and perception, and Nav2 for humanoid locomotion and path planning.

- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Master Whisper voice-to-intent pipeline, LLM-based cognitive planning (NL → ROS 2 actions), object detection + manipulation pipeline, and build an autonomous humanoid control system.

## Interactive Learning Experience

This book provides a unique interactive learning experience with:

- Hands-on robotics workflows using the modular subagent system

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with robotics concepts is helpful but not required

## How to Use This Book

1. Start with Module 1 and progress sequentially through the modules
2. Try the hands-on exercises in each chapter
3. Complete the capstone project to integrate everything you've learned

Let's begin your journey into the fascinating world of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics!
