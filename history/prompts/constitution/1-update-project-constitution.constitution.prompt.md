# Prompt History Record: Update Project Constitution

## Prompt Text

```

You are a senior Full-Stack Architect and AI Engineer.

## Response Text

Updated the project constitution to formalize the governance structure for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Platform. The constitution establishes six core principles (Documentation-First Approach, Multi-Modal AI Integration, Test-First Development, Modular Architecture, Cross-Platform Compatibility, and Human-Centered Design) along with technical standards and development workflow guidelines. Version incremented from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 with today's date as the amendment date. Conducted sync impact analysis to ensure consistency with existing templates.

## Outcome

The project constitution has been successfully updated and now serves as the authoritative governance document for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Platform project. The constitution establishes clear principles and guidelines that will guide all future development decisions.
